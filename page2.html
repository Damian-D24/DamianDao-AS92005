                    <p class="imageflexcontent">This study from Maanaki Whenua (Landcare Research) was conducted through 2013-2023, and 2018-2023.<br>Over 10 years from 2013 to 2023, garden bird counts have increased overall for: Kererū, Fantail, Greenfinch, Tūī, and Blackbird; including some minimal changes with the: Myna, Song Thrush, and Bellbird. The decade also showed decline for various species: House Sparrow, Starling, Silvereye, Goldfinch, Dunnock, Chaffinch.<br><br>Although, in five years between 2018 and 2023, bird populations have barely increased and have been declining more rapidly. The only bird to  have a shallow increase is the fantail with a 12% increase. Tūī, Song Thrush, Blackbird, Myna, Bellbird, and Starling species have had minimal change. While Greenfinch, Dunnock, and Kererū have had a shallow decline, and the House Sparrow and Silvereye had a moderate decline. Unfortunately, the Goldfinch and Chaffinch have a rapid decline of 30%.<br><br>From this graph, we can infer that bird populations have not been increasing, but rather have been declining rapidly. This may be due to environmental pressures from an increasing human population requiring more houses to live in, more food to eat, or affecting the environment.</p>

                    <p class="imageflexcontent">This study from Forest and Bird is from 2024. Forest and Bird is Aotearoa's independent conservation organisation.<br>Forest & Bird investigated councils around the country to fix rules for vehicles on beaches after only Dunedin City scored the top ranking for protecting coastal species. <br><br>The investigation reveals that 73% of New Zealand’s councils have inadequate bylaws, monitoring, and compliance for vehicles on beaches. This leaves coastal species vulnerable and unprotected.<br><br>These coastal species include shorebirds such as albatrosses, black billed gulls, penguins, and New Zealand dotterel.<br><br>Vehicles on beaches combined with other issues such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change affect the livelihood of the individuals in our many coastal bird species. Human factors such as habitat loss and devastation (development on coastal areas, land reclamation), human disturbance (recreational activities, increased visitor numbers), and introduced predators (mammalian predators) all impact the coastal bird species in New Zealand.</p>

                    <p class="imageflexcontent" style="text-align:right;">The Department of Conservation has collected some facts about the threats to kiwi in this article.<br><br><b>These facts include:</b>
                            <i><br>There are about 70,000 kiwi left in New Zealand. We are losing 2% of our unmanaged kiwi in the wild every year, which is about 20 kiwi per week. This number does vary through population to population.
                            <br><br>Without human help, only 10% of baby kiwi chicks survive to the age of six months. This is because young chicks are vulnerable to stoats and mammalian predators before they reach one kilogram in weight.
                            <br><br>In Northland, adult Northland brown kiwi are expected to live 14 years on average, due to dogs.
                            <br><br>Dogs frequently kill adult kiwi and can cause catastrophic declines in local populations. Any dog regardness of their size, breed, and training are potential kiwi killers. A dog can still kill a kiwi by giving it a playful push.</i>
