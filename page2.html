                    <p class="imageflexcontent">This study from Maanaki Whenua (Landcare Research) was conducted through 2013-2023, and 2018-2023.<br>Over 10 years from 2013 to 2023, garden bird counts have increased overall for: Kererū, Fantail, Greenfinch, Tūī, and Blackbird; including some minimal changes with the: Myna, Song Thrush, and Bellbird. The decade also showed decline for various species: House Sparrow, Starling, Silvereye, Goldfinch, Dunnock, Chaffinch.<br><br>Although, in five years between 2018 and 2023, bird populations have barely increased and have been declining more rapidly. The only bird to  have a shallow increase is the fantail with a 12% increase. Tūī, Song Thrush, Blackbird, Myna, Bellbird, and Starling species have had minimal change. While Greenfinch, Dunnock, and Kererū have had a shallow decline, and the House Sparrow and Silvereye had a moderate decline. Unfortunately, the Goldfinch and Chaffinch have a rapid decline of 30%.<br><br>From this graph, we can infer that bird populations have not been increasing, but rather have been declining rapidly. This may be due to environmental pressures from an increasing human population requiring more houses to live in, more food to eat, or affecting the environment.</p>
