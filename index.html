            <p>Welcome to the Bird Advisory page. This webpage will provide information on New Zealand's bird species and their vulnerability through: facts/science, bird sanctuaries (Tiritiri Matangi), and ways you can get involved with New Zealand's birds. Overall promoting the idea of Kaitiakitanga</p>
            <p>A range of news about the vulnerability of New Zealand's birds, an overview about one of New Zealand's bird sanctuaries, and activites to get into protecting New Zealand's environment and native birds.</p>
            <p>Author: Damian Dao (Mount Roskill Grammar School)</p>
            <p>We aim to show values of Kaitiakitanga and inform people about conservation. Kaitiakitanga means guardianship and protection. It is a way of managing the environment, based on the Māori world view. In the Māori world view, people are closely connected to the land and nature. As Kaitiakitanga is based on the idea of humans being a part of the natural world, we hope to inspire people to take action, and promote conservation.</p>

                    <p>New Zealand has lost 40–50% of its bird species over the past 1000 years. This is due to introduced mammals that predate on the native birds. </p>
